					<h2>Award Ceremony -- 12/22/2012</h2>
					<p>Hearts hosted an award ceremony/fundraiser to present Presidential Service Awards to the 16 individuals who earned it the past year. Over 70 people attended the fundraiser, raising $1030 in total. Saratoga City Planning Commissioner Yan Zhao and Former Cupertino City Mayor Kris Wang spoke during the ceremony as well, and there were many performances including pieces by the Fu Xu Fang Gu Zheng studio.</p>
					<p>After the ceremony, many of the kids and adults drove to a nearby homeless center where they performed again and celebrated the holidays with the children there. Hearts also collected 60 gifts for the homeless children, which was sent to the shelter 2 days later. Thank you to all that attended or performed and extra thanks to those who performed at the homeless shelter!</p>
