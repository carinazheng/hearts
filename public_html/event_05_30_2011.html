					<h2>Dinner Fundraiser -- 05/30/2011</h2>
					<p>The Second Hearts Fundraising Dinner Party was held on May 30th, 2011 at Varian Park 22200 Varian Way Cupertino, CA. There were many performances including performances from the Firebird Youth Chinese Orchestra, the Chiffon Fu GuZheng Ensemble, and the Fremont Dancing school as well as many volunteer performers. More than 80 people attended the party and we raised more than $2140.00. The money will be used to support underprivileged kids in China, India, and other undeveloped places. The money will also be used to donate food and fresh produce to homeless and hungry people in our area. </p>
					<p>Special thanks to all the people who were there to show support, to the people who were unable to come but made donations, and to the people who volunteered at the fundraising party. Our thanks also goes out to the Firebird Youth Chinese Orchestra, Chiffon Fu Gu-Zheng Ensemble, The Academy of Chinese Performing Arts Foundation, and all of those who performed.We also want to thank the Lucky in Los Altos, the Safeway in Sunnyvale, the Little Caesars Pizza in Sunnyvale, the Marina food in Cupertino, and the Costco in Sunnyvale for their donations. Thank you to everyone who helped out, your support helped provide a child with education and made a difference in their lives. We hope to see you again!</p>
